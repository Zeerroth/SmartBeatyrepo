SKIN_CONDITION_PROFILES = {
    "Oily Skin": """
Oily skin is characterized by an overproduction of sebum, the skin's natural oil, by the sebaceous glands. This often results in a persistently shiny or greasy appearance, particularly in the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin). Individuals with oily skin typically experience enlarged and more visible pores, which can become easily clogged, leading to a higher propensity for blackheads, whiteheads, and acne breakouts.

Key Characteristics & Concerns:
- Shiny, greasy complexion, especially noticeable a few hours after cleansing.
- Enlarged, visible pores.
- Prone to comedones (blackheads and whiteheads).
- Increased likelihood of pimples, pustules, and other forms of acne.
- Makeup may tend to slide off, fade quickly, or change color during the day.
- Skin can feel thick or coarse.

Skincare Goals & Needs:
The primary goal for oily skin is to manage excess sebum, minimize shine, keep pores clear, and prevent breakouts, all without overly stripping the skin of its natural moisture, which can paradoxically trigger even more oil production.

Beneficial Product Attributes & Ingredients:
- Cleansers: Gel-based, foaming, or clay-based cleansers that effectively remove excess oil and impurities. Look for ingredients like salicylic acid (BHA) for oil-soluble exfoliation within the pores, or gentle surfactants.
- Exfoliants: Chemical exfoliants like salicylic acid (BHA) or alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs such as glycolic or lactic acid) to help shed dead skin cells and prevent clogged pores. Physical exfoliants should be gentle.
- Toners: Astringent or balancing toners (often alcohol-free to avoid over-drying) can help remove residual cleanser and temporarily tighten pores. Ingredients like witch hazel (used judiciously), tea tree oil, or green tea can be beneficial.
- Serums & Treatments: Lightweight, water-based serums. Niacinamide is excellent for regulating oil production, minimizing pore appearance, and improving skin barrier function. Retinoids (adapalene, tretinoin, retinol) can help normalize cell turnover and reduce oiliness.
- Moisturizers: Contrary to common belief, oily skin still needs hydration. Opt for oil-free, non-comedogenic, lightweight gel, lotion, or fluid moisturizers. Ingredients like hyaluronic acid or glycerin provide hydration without heaviness.
- Sunscreens: Gel-based, fluid, or matte-finish sunscreens that are non-comedogenic and oil-free.
- Masks: Clay masks (kaolin, bentonite) are effective at absorbing excess oil and drawing out impurities.
- Keywords: Look for "oil-control," "mattifying," "non-comedogenic," "pore-refining," "clarifying," "lightweight."

Attributes & Ingredients to Approach with Caution or Avoid:
- Heavy, occlusive creams and rich oils (e.g., coconut oil, mineral oil in high concentrations for some).
- Harsh, stripping cleansers or alcohol-based toners that can dehydrate the skin and trigger rebound oiliness.
- Comedogenic ingredients.
- Over-exfoliation.

    "Wrinkles": """
Wrinkles, encompassing both fine lines and deeper furrows, are visible creases or folds in the skin that develop as a natural part of the aging process. They occur due to a combination of intrinsic factors (genetics, natural decline in collagen and elastin production) and extrinsic factors (sun exposure, environmental pollutants, smoking, repetitive facial expressions). As skin ages, it loses elasticity, volume, and moisture, making it more susceptible to creasing.

Key Characteristics & Concerns:
- Fine Lines: Small, shallow creases often appearing first around the eyes ('crow's feet'), mouth, and forehead.
- Deeper Wrinkles/Furrows: More prominent, set-in lines that are visible even when the face is at rest.
- Loss of skin firmness and elasticity.
- Skin may appear thinner or more fragile.
- Dullness or uneven skin texture can accompany wrinkles.

Skincare Goals & Needs:
The primary goals for addressing wrinkles are to stimulate collagen and elastin production, improve skin hydration and plumpness, protect against further damage, and smooth the skin's surface to reduce the visibility of existing lines. Prevention is also a key aspect.

Beneficial Product Attributes & Ingredients:
- Retinoids (Vitamin A derivatives): Gold standard for anti-aging. Includes retinol, retinaldehyde, adapalene, and prescription tretinoin. They accelerate cell turnover, stimulate collagen synthesis, and improve skin texture.
- Peptides: Short chains of amino acids that can act as signaling molecules to encourage collagen production (e.g., Matrixyl, copper peptides) or provide a temporary muscle-relaxing effect (e.g., Argireline).
- Antioxidants: Vitamins C (L-Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, etc.) and E, Ferulic Acid, Resveratrol, Green Tea Extract. These neutralize free radicals from UV exposure and pollution, protecting existing collagen and supporting repair. Vitamin C also plays a role in collagen synthesis.
- Alpha-Hydroxy Acids (AHAs): Glycolic acid and lactic acid exfoliate the skin's surface, promoting cell renewal, improving texture, and reducing the appearance of fine lines.
- Hyaluronic Acid: A powerful humectant that draws moisture into the skin, temporarily plumping it up and making fine lines less noticeable.
- Sunscreen (Broad Spectrum SPF 30+): Absolutely crucial for preventing further photoaging, which is a primary driver of wrinkle formation. Daily use is non-negotiable.
- Moisturizers: Richer creams or lotions containing ceramides, fatty acids, and cholesterol to support the skin barrier, lock in moisture, and improve skin suppleness.
- Growth Factors: Can help support skin repair and regeneration processes.
- Keywords: "Anti-aging," "anti-wrinkle," "firming," "collagen-boosting," "smoothing," "rejuvenating," "cell renewal."

Attributes & Ingredients to Approach with Caution or Avoid:
- Over-exfoliation, which can irritate the skin and compromise the skin barrier.
- Not using sunscreen, which negates the benefits of other anti-aging products.
- Starting high concentrations of potent actives (like retinoids) too quickly, leading to irritation.

    "Redness": """
Facial redness refers to a visible flushing, persistent pink or red hue on the skin, often accompanied by sensitivity, irritation, and sometimes visible blood vessels (telangiectasias or spider veins). It can be a symptom of various underlying conditions such as rosacea, general skin sensitivity, allergic reactions, eczema, or a compromised skin barrier. External triggers like sun exposure, heat, spicy foods, alcohol, stress, and harsh skincare products can often exacerbate redness.

Key Characteristics & Concerns:
- Persistent or intermittent flushing or blushing.
- A generally rosy or ruddy complexion.
- Visible small blood vessels, particularly on the cheeks, nose, and chin.
- Skin may feel warm, tight, itchy, or burning.
- Increased reactivity to new products or environmental changes.
- Bumps or pimple-like lesions (in some cases, like with rosacea).
- Dryness or flakiness can sometimes accompany redness.

Skincare Goals & Needs:
The primary goals are to calm and soothe irritation, strengthen the skin barrier, reduce visible redness, protect the skin from triggers, and provide gentle hydration. Identifying and avoiding individual triggers is also crucial.

Beneficial Product Attributes & Ingredients:
- Soothing & Calming Ingredients: Centella Asiatica (Cica, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside), Allantoin, Bisabolol, Chamomile, Calendula, Green Tea Extract, Aloe Vera, Licorice Root Extract, Colloidal Oatmeal.
- Barrier-Repairing Ingredients: Ceramides, Niacinamide (can be very helpful for some, but start low as it can cause flushing in very sensitive individuals initially), Cholesterol, Fatty Acids, Panthenol (Provitamin B5).
- Anti-inflammatory Ingredients: Azelaic Acid (particularly good for rosacea-related redness and bumps), Niacinamide.
- Gentle Cleansers: Cream, lotion, or micellar water cleansers that are fragrance-free, soap-free, and non-foaming or low-foaming. pH-balanced.
- Hydrators: Simple, fragrance-free moisturizers and serums with humectants like hyaluronic acid and glycerin, and emollients/occlusives that support the barrier.
- Sunscreen: Mineral-based (physical) sunscreens containing Zinc Oxide and/or Titanium Dioxide are often better tolerated by sensitive, red-prone skin than chemical sunscreens. Broad spectrum SPF 30+ is essential.
- Keywords: "Soothing," "calming," "anti-redness," "sensitive skin," "barrier repair," "gentle," "fragrance-free," "hypoallergenic," "non-irritating."

Attributes & Ingredients to Approach with Caution or Avoid:
- Fragrances (synthetic and natural/essential oils): Common irritants.
- Alcohol (SD alcohol, denatured alcohol): Can be drying and irritating.
- Harsh Sulfates (SLS, SLES) in cleansers.
- Abrasive physical exfoliants (scrubs with large, jagged particles).
- Many chemical exfoliants (AHAs/BHAs) at high concentrations or used too frequently, unless specifically tolerated or recommended for a condition like rosacea under guidance.
- Common allergens or known personal irritants.
- Menthol, camphor, peppermint, eucalyptus oil.
- Witch hazel (can be irritating for some due to tannins).
- Over-washing or using water that is too hot.

    "Eye Bags": """
Eye bags refer to the mild swelling, puffiness, or protrusions that can develop under the eyes. They are distinct from dark circles, although the two often occur together. Eye bags can be caused by a variety of factors including genetics, aging (loss of skin elasticity and fat pad displacement), fluid retention (due to diet, allergies, sinus issues, or lack of sleep), lifestyle factors (smoking, excessive alcohol), and sometimes underlying medical conditions. Dark circles, on the other hand, can be due to pigmentation, thinning skin revealing underlying blood vessels, or shadowing from puffiness.

Key Characteristics & Concerns:
- Puffiness/Swelling: A noticeable bulge or swollen appearance under the eyes.
- Dark Circles: Discoloration under the eyes, appearing blue, purple, brown, or black depending on skin tone and cause.
- Shadowing: The contour created by puffiness can cast a shadow, exacerbating the appearance of dark circles.
- Skin around the eyes may appear tired or less firm.
- Fine lines and wrinkles can also be present in the under-eye area.

Skincare Goals & Needs:
The goals for addressing eye bags and dark circles depend on the primary cause. General aims include reducing fluid retention, constricting blood vessels (temporarily), improving skin elasticity and thickness, brightening pigmentation, and hydrating the delicate eye area. Lifestyle adjustments are often key.

Beneficial Product Attributes & Ingredients:
- For Puffiness (Fluid Retention):
    - Caffeine: A vasoconstrictor that can temporarily reduce swelling and improve circulation.
    - Cooling/De-puffing Applicators: Metal rollerballs or ceramic tips can provide a cooling effect.
    - Ingredients with mild diuretic or circulation-boosting properties: Green tea extract, arnica (use with caution, very diluted).
    - Peptides that target puffiness: E.g., Eyeseryl (Acetyl Tetrapeptide-5).
- For Dark Circles (Pigmentation):
    - Vitamin C: An antioxidant that can brighten skin and inhibit melanin production.
    - Niacinamide: Can help improve skin barrier and reduce inflammation, potentially improving some types of dark circles.
    - Retinoids (gentle, eye-specific formulations): Can thicken the dermis over time, making underlying vessels less visible, and improve cell turnover. Use with extreme caution around the eyes.
    - Arbutin, Kojic Acid, Licorice Root Extract: Skin-lightening agents that inhibit melanin.
    - Vitamin K (Oxide): Thought to help with vascular dark circles by strengthening capillary walls, though evidence is mixed.
- For Firmness & Fine Lines:
    - Peptides: (e.g., Matrixyl, Argireline) to support collagen and elastin.
    - Retinoids (eye-specific): As mentioned above.
    - Hyaluronic Acid: For hydration and plumping.
- General Eye Area Care:
    - Gentle, fragrance-free formulations: The eye area is very delicate.
    - Lightweight textures: Creams, gels, or serums specifically designed for the eyes.
    - Hydration: Keeping the area well-moisturized can improve its overall appearance.
- Keywords: "Eye cream," "eye serum," "de-puffing," "brightening," "anti-fatigue," "dark circle corrector," "firming eye treatment."

Lifestyle Factors & Non-Product Interventions:
